<h3><em>Where am  I from?</em></h3>

<ul> I have lived in 6 states, including: South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, and Georgia. My family and I have had to move a lot because of my dad's job. There are pros and cons to moving, and it was hard leaving my friends all the time; however, I am glad I ended up at the University of Georgia for college after moving to Georgia after my senior year.</ul>
<ul> Upon moving to Georgia after my senior year, I first took a gap year. During my gap year, I traveled to Italy, Malawi, and Haiti. I also worked as a cashier at Publix after all my traveling came to an end. Oh, and I went skydiving too! (Below is a video from my Malawi trip!)</ul>

<ul> Italy was full of adventure and I got to see so many things I had only heard about at one point. It was especially amazing seeing the city of Florence at night, it was so beautiful! In Malawi, I worked at CURE hospital with the kids that were being treated there. My team and I built a playroom for them throughout the week, and got to keep the kids company while they healed from their surgeries. In Haiti, my team and I did prayer walks around the village of Kalapa, led a Vacation Bible School, and got to learn so much about their culture-- we even cooked several meals with them!</ul>
<ul> My gap year fostered my adventurous spirit and allowed to go on so many amazing trips and adventures, and that has carried over into my life now. I love all that Athens offers and exploring this amazing city is my favorite thing! </ul>
